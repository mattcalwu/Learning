# README.md

This is a course that I have picked up many years ago but never finished. 
I believe I only made through about 30% of this course. I also quickly learned
that writing all my notes has been inefficient, especially when it comes to
learning how to code.

The hope is that by taking notes via typing, the way we all code, I will have an
easier time to learn the material. Now that I am a software engineer, the
material also should be more familiar and applicable in my work environment.
