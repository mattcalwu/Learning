# Kotlin

This is where I practice my understanding of the Kotlin language, starting with
the basic data types and syntax!

Most of my notes are based on me walking through these examples [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)

## Kotlin Notebooks

I am using kotlin notebooks to practice around with the basic data types of kotlin.

For some basic notes on how I set it up (No Anaconda):

- pip3 install jupyter
- pip3 install kotlin-jupyter-kernel

Lastly all I did was run

`jupyter notebook`

And then set the kernel to be kotlin.

I am using the open source kotlin-jupyter-demo found [here](https://github.com/cheptsov/kotlin-jupyter-demo/blob/master/index.ipynb)

Update:

`jupyter notebook`

No longer works, run

`jupyter lab`
